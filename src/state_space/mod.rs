//! # State-Space
//!
//! "The idea of **state-space** comes from the state-variable method of describing differential
//! equations. In this method, the differential equations describing a dynamic system are
//! organized as a set of first order differential equations in the vector-valued state of
//! the system. The solution is visualized as a trajectory of this state vector in space.
//! **state-space control design** is the technique in which the control engineer designs a
//! dynamic compensation by working directly with the state-variable description of the system"
