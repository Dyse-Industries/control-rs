//! # Transfer Function
//!
//! "A transfer function is a convenient way to represent a linear, time-invariant system in terms
//! of its input-output relationship. It is obtained by applying a Laplace transform to the
//! differential equations describing system dynamics, assuming zero initial conditions. In the
//! absence of these equations, a transfer function can also be estimated from measured
//! input-output data.
//!
//! Transfer functions are frequently used in block diagram representations of systems and are
//! popular for performing time-domain and frequency-domain analyses and controller design. The
//! key advantage of transfer functions is that they allow engineers to use simple algebraic
//! equations instead of complex differential equations for analyzing and designing systems."
